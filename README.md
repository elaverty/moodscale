# moodscale
This is a simple web app to create custom mood scales collages out of nine images.
I used this frequently during hybrid teaching as it provided a great way to check in with
students.

The user is asked to upload several photos and then those photos are arranged in a collage with numbers.

The user can adjust the colors and the title.


Example output:
